## Public Business Website

This single page website serves as the landing page for my public business website, it then gives the users the option to re-direct themselves to whatever website they are looking for. In addition to these two, there is a third unlisted section that has the details for my gaming/content creating setups.

It's a simple HTML & CSS website using Bootstrap, and was developed as a part of an 100 day coding challenge for web development.

### Sub-sections

### Running & Bug Finding
If you want to run the website to test for bugs or just mess around, all you have to do is download it and open the HTML files with your prefered browser.

Feel free to report bugs at the bug page here on GitHub and I'll address them!
